It includes 12460 images.
Elephant are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -12 and +12 degrees
* Random shear of between -2째 to +2째 horizontally and -2째 to +2째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
